# 3D data for Mercedes 190E
At your own risk - not formally checked for accuracy.

Parts were 3D scanned and then reverse engineered to an actual model.

## Instrument Cluster
Only the exterior housing and front (driver visible) face were scanned/modelled.

## Rear Subframe
All modelled, but not verified for accuracy.   Dimensions for suspension attachment holes/slots were manually measured and fed into the model as well.
